        <p>Welcome to my blog that will chronicle my jourey from no real coding skill to someone who, through self teaching,
         has created their own Indie game, and followed their dreams. 
         <br>This website, designed by myself, will be a blog and showcase for all the progress I've made as a coder, 
        as well as all progress I am making towards my game. </p>
