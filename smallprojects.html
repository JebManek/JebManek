        <h2>First Website</h2>
            <p>This website, as well as being a blog about myself and the progress I make towards my dream,
             is also a tool for me to practice coding in HTML. 
             <br>As such this website will be a visual representation of how far my skills as a coder have come.
        <h2>First "Game"</h2>
            <p>Starting in python I created a small py gae where the objective as to survive as long as possible, while increasing your score per kill. 
            Unfortunatey the game itself was lost when I purchased a new custom computer as there was no backup for my old files.</p>
            </p>
        <h2>GMS Games</h2>
            <p>Game Maker Studio 2 is the next step in my journey to becoming a video game designer,
             and as such I needed a way to quickly see if it was the type of editor that I was looking for.
             <br>The introduction/tutorial itself recommended I create the game asteroids to do so, but wanting to make it harder on myself,
              I did make asteroids, but tried to use the tutorial itself as little as possible. I would only use the tutorial if I was completey stuck and needed to refer to it to continue.
             But this also meant that without the tutorial, I couldn't add any sounds to the game seeing as how I have no idea how to do anything related to sound design. But hopefully,
            using asteroids/Space rocks as the tutorial recommended I name it, I'll be able to learn a bit about that too.</p>
